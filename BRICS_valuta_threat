<h1>The Historical Evolution of BRICS and Its Implications for Western Currencies</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
    This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the historical evolution of BRICS—an association of five major emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—and examines how its development poses a significant threat to Western currencies, specifically the euro and the dollar. By exploring the juridical foundations and explicit policy goals of BRICS, this article elucidates the technical mechanisms through which BRICS challenges the hegemony of Western currencies in global finance.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    The BRICS nations collectively represent a significant portion of the world's population, landmass, and economic output. Since its inception, BRICS has sought to redefine the global economic landscape by promoting multipolarity and challenging the dominance of Western financial institutions and currencies. This article delves into the historical evolution of BRICS and analyzes its strategic policies aimed at undermining the euro and the dollar.
</p>

<h2>Historical Evolution of BRICS</h2>

<h3>Formation and Expansion</h3>
<p>
    The term "BRIC" was first coined in 2001 by economist Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs, referring to Brazil, Russia, India, and China as emerging economic powerhouses. In 2006, the four countries initiated regular consultations, leading to the formal establishment of BRIC as a diplomatic and economic bloc. South Africa joined the group in 2010, expanding the acronym to BRICS.
</p>

<h3>Key Milestones</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2009:</strong> First BRIC Summit held in Yekaterinburg, Russia.</li>
    <li><strong>2014:</strong> Establishment of the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) during the Fortaleza Summit in Brazil.</li>
    <li><strong>2015:</strong> Operationalization of the NDB with an initial authorized capital of $100 billion.</li>
    <li><strong>2020:</strong> BRICS nations agree to enhance cooperation in digital economy and innovation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>BRICS Policies and Goals</h2>

<h3>Economic Policies</h3>
<p>
    BRICS has implemented several economic initiatives aimed at reducing dependency on Western financial systems:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>New Development Bank:</strong> Provides funding for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies.</li>
    <li><strong>Contingent Reserve Arrangement:</strong> Offers financial support to members during balance of payment crises, reducing reliance on the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</li>
    <li><strong>Local Currency Settlements:</strong> Promotes trade among member countries using local currencies to minimize exposure to the dollar and euro.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Juridical Arguments</h3>
<p>
    BRICS challenges the legal frameworks that underpin the current international financial system, which is largely governed by institutions like the IMF and the World Bank. The juridical arguments include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sovereign Equality:</strong> Advocates for equal representation and voting rights in global financial institutions, opposing the disproportionate influence of Western nations.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Pluralism:</strong> Supports the coexistence of multiple legal systems and financial regulations, promoting a more diversified global governance structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Contractual Autonomy:</strong> Encourages member states to engage in bilateral and multilateral agreements that bypass traditional Western-dominated legal mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Explicit Policy Goals</h3>
<p>
    The explicit policy goals of BRICS are outlined in their annual summit declarations and include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Financial Sovereignty:</strong> Reduce dependency on Western financial instruments and promote alternative systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Collaboration:</strong> Enhance intra-BRICS trade and investment through policy coordination and the removal of trade barriers.</li>
    <li><strong>Global Governance Reform:</strong> Advocate for reforms in international institutions to reflect the changing global economic landscape.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact on Western Currencies</h2>

<h3>Threat to the Euro and Dollar</h3>
<p>
    The strategic initiatives undertaken by BRICS pose a multifaceted threat to the dominance of the euro and the dollar:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>De-dollarization:</strong> By conducting trade in local currencies, BRICS reduces demand for the dollar, potentially weakening its value and influence.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative Financial Institutions:</strong> The NDB and CRA offer substitutes to the World Bank and IMF, decreasing Western control over global finance.</li>
    <li><strong>Currency Swap Agreements:</strong> Facilitate liquidity and financial stability among BRICS nations without resorting to Western currencies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Analysis</h3>
<p>
    From a technical standpoint, the shift towards local currencies and the establishment of parallel financial institutions disrupt the traditional mechanisms through which the euro and dollar maintain global dominance:

        <th>Mechanism</th>
        <th>Impact on Western Currencies</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Trade Settlement in Local Currencies</td>
        <td>Reduces the transactional demand for euro and dollar.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>BRICS Payment Systems</td>
        <td>Bypasses SWIFT, diminishing the euro and dollar's role in international payments.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sovereign Debt Issuance in Local Currencies</td>
        <td>Decreases dependency on Western capital markets.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    The historical evolution of BRICS reflects a concerted effort to challenge the hegemony of Western currencies through strategic economic policies and juridical arguments. By fostering financial sovereignty and promoting alternative institutions, BRICS not only strengthens its member nations but also poses a significant threat to the global dominance of the euro and the dollar. The long-term implications of these developments could lead to a more multipolar and diversified international monetary system.
